		<p class="indented">This is a project I did over summer 2020 for a BU CS200 class taugh by XRTerra. I worked with 2 teammates on this, and we did the whole project in unity. I did the art and models as well as about a third of the scripting. <a href="https://github.com/elatorre20/Packet39-Crane-Simulator">You can download the latest build as well as source code on my github.</a></p>
		
		<h1>• Intel MCS-85 System Development Kit restoration</h1>

		<center><img src="Images/Projects/MCS_85.JPG" width="408" height="auto" alt="the MCS-85 devkit circuit board"></center>
		
		<p class="indented">I am attempting to restore and modify an intel systems development kit from the collection of the Rhode Island Computer Museum. The MCS-85 is a barebones kit sold by intel in the late 70s for hardware manufacturers to design systems around the 8085a processor. The kit provides 256 bytes of ram, a monitor loaded into ROM, and a rudimentary I/O system consisting of a 24-key keyboard and single-line 6-digit display. While this is theoretically enough to program the system, the kit is intended for the user to supply additional hardware to fit the needs of whatever they are designing. So far I have succeeded in adding a connection for a teleprinter terminal as well as an additional 256 bytes of ram. A more detailed look at the kit and restoration is available <a href="https://www.ricomputermuseum.org/collections-gallery/small-systems-at-ricm/intel-mcs-85">on the RICM website.</a>Thanks to the other volunteers at the museum for allowing me to use the collection and providing documentation and other help.</p>
