		<p class="indented">Over the summer of 2021, Dan Berman, curator at the Rhode Island Computer Museum, asked me to design a new kit for use in the Museum's "learn electronics" workshops for elementary-school children. After thinking about what hardware might be interesting for the project, I settled on a Raspberry Pi Pico, because of its low cost and the ability to program it directly in Python. Mike Thompson and I then designed and laid out a circuit board for the hardware I had selected, and we were able to construct several of the kits. The latest iteration costs only $20 for all components and the PCB, allowing us to provide the kit for workshops. Thanks to Dan Berman and RICM for funding the project and Mike Thompson for his help in laying out the board. </p>
