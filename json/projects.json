        "bodytext"      : "I recently decided that my 6-year old CR10-S 3d printer was overdue for an upgrade. The mechanical aspects are solid, but the control board was based on an ancient 8-bit AVR and struggled to load many advanced features in marlin, and did not have an additional stepper driver for a second extruder. I decided to fully replace all the electronics in the printer, going for a BTT Octopus pro motherboard with STM32F429 MCU, TMC2209 UART stepper drivers, and a 5-inch color TFT for display. As this hardware and the necessary PSU to supply it does not fit in the original electronics case, I fabricated a set of custom mounting brackets and installed the motherboard and screen in a vintage 2003 HP ATX case. AS this left lots of space, I decided to add an additional board with an RP2040 to control some case features, including indicator LEDS, ambient temperature and humidity monitoring, a soft power-on button, temperature-controlled cooling fans, and RGB lighting. I additionally added custom M codes to the printer firmware to allow the motherboard to communicate with the case board over I2C.",

I selected <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism\"> the antikythera mechanism</a>, an ancient greek mechanical computer used to calculate the cycles of various astronomical objects. I decided that my replica would be somewhat simplified, calculating only the cycles of the sun and moon through one metonic cycle. After calculating the necessary ratios, I designed a geartrain in Onshape that would move the pointers appropriately, then cut the backplate and all the gears on a CNC waterjet cutter.</p><center><img src=\"/Images/Projects/Antikythera4.png\" style=\"width:60%\" alt=\"The antikythera mechanism open in Onshape\"><br><img src=\"/Images/Projects/Antikythera3.jpg\" alt=\"The final assembled mechanism, turned to show the gears\"></center><p class=\"indented\"> I turned the pins manually on a lathe. A classmate drew a beatiful decoration, which we scanned and etched onto the plate using laser marking fluid. The final result works very well, and is accurate to within one lunar month through a 19-solar year metonic cycle. (It could be made more accurate by using precut gears, but that was over budget for this project unfortunately.)

I interfaced this to the hardware serial port of an Arduino through a level shifter, and this allowed the Arduino to read the engine diagnostic port directly.

The Greenpower foundation used to provide a <a href=\"https://www.greenpower.co.uk/product/340\">telemetry kit</a> which measured important statsitics about the car, but as it was very expensive and not available in the US, the museum asked me to design a replacement. Using the original kit as a guide for requirements, I selected parts, designed and ordered a board, and assembled a prototype kit. The kit measures car telemetry statistics like battery level, motor current consumption, motor temperature, and acceleration. We also added additional hardware to display statistics to the driver, and to log data to an SD card for the students to use in redesigning the car.",

It was in pretty decent shape, with the mods halfway to where I wanted it, but the cafe racer bars and seat were very uncomfortable and the carbs and some electrics needed an overhaul. I fully disassembled and rebuilt the carbs, fixing the jetting for the individual velocity stack intakes that replace the stock airbox. After that I swapped the bars for a more comfortable vintage buckhorn handlebar from a BSA. This also meant swapping the brake line, grips, and hand controls. I selected a new seat that kept with the cafe racer style but is much more comfortable and padded, and fabricated a mounting bracket setup on the water jet cutter. I also cut a new dashboard on the waterjet and replaced the indicator lights with a new matching set. It turned out very clean, with nothing unnecessary remaining but keeping true to the vintage cafe racer style.",

Mike Thompson and I then designed and laid out a circuit board for the hardware I had selected, and we were able to construct several of the kits. The latest iteration costs only $20 for all components and the PCB, allowing us to provide the kit for workshops.
