        <p class="indented">I recently decided that my 6-year old CR10-S 3d printer was overdue for an upgrade. The mechanical aspects are solid, but the control board was based on an ancient 8-bit AVR and struggled to load many advanced features in marlin, and did not have an additional stepper driver for a second extruder. I decided to fully replace all the electronics in the printer, going for a BTT Octopus pro motherboard with STM32F429 MCU, TMC2209 UART stepper drivers, and a 5-inch color TFT for display. As this hardware and the necessary PSU to supply it does not fit in the original electronics case, I fabricated a set of custom mounting brackets and installed the motherboard and screen in a vintage 2003 HP ATX case. AS this left lots of space, I decided to add an additional board with an RP2040 to control some case features, including indicator LEDS, ambient temperature and humidity monitoring, a soft power-on button, temperature-controlled cooling fans, and RGB lighting. All features on the case board are currently working, and I am currently working on custom Gcodes in the motherboard firmware to big-bang serial communcation with the case board.</p>

        <p class="indented">In spring 2023, I was assigned in a history class to research an ancient technology and produce a replica of it. I selected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism"> the antikythera mechanism</a>, an ancient greek mechanical computer used to calculate the cycles of various astronomical objects. I decided that my replica would be somewhat simplified, calculating only the cycles of the sun and moon through one metonic cycle. After calculating the necessary ratios, I designed a geartrain in Onshape that would move the pointers appropriately, then cut the backplate and all the gears on a CNC waterjet cutter.</p><center><img src="/Images/Projects/Antikythera4.png" style="width:60%" alt="The antikythera mechanism open in Onshape"><br><img src="/Images/Projects/Antikythera3.jpg" alt="The final assembled mechanism, turned to show the gears"></center><p class="indented"> I turned the pins manually on a lathe. A classmate drew a beatiful decoration, which we scanned and etched onto the plate using laser marking fluid. The final result works very well, and is accurate to within one lunar month through a 19-solar year metonic cycle. All my CAD work for this project can be viewed in <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/fc21ad6d6818652dfa3de00a/w/8da94a5a13b07d3b56da41dc/e/8dd0d99777bb699bf4ebc674?renderMode=0&uiState=64b1d3429099670484c77129">the public Onshape document.</a></p>

		<h1><strong>F24 Greenpower Telemetry Board</strong></h1>
		
		<center><img src="/Images/Projects/Greenpower_Telemetry.jpg" width="408" height="auto" alt="The F24 GreenPower telemetry"></center>
		
		<p class="indented">In 2022, the <a href="https://www.ricomputermuseum.org/">Rhode Island Computer Museum</a> began sponsoring several Rhode Island high schools in establishing a <a href = "https://greenpowerusa.net/f24-grades-6-12">Greenpower F24</a> electric gokart racing league. The primary purpose of the project is to give the students hands-on practice with fabrication, electronics, and mechanical engineering. The Greenpower foundation used to provide a <a href="https://www.greenpower.co.uk/product/340">telemetry kit</a> which measured important statsitics about the car. However, as it was very expensive and not available in the US, the museum asked me to design a replacement. Using the original kit as a guide for requirements, I selected parts, designed and ordered a board, and assembled a prototype kit. The kit measures car telemetry statistics like battery level, motor current consumption, motor temperature, and acceleration. We also added additional hardware to display statistics to the driver, and to log data to an SD card for the students to use in redesigning the car. All the Kicad files including the board layout, diagram, and BOM can be accessed on my github. Brian Jepson from the museum is assisting with software.</p>

		<center><img src="/Images/Projects/Honda1.jpg" width="408" height="auto" alt="A black 1972 Honda CB350F, heavily modified in the cafe racer style."></center>
		
		<p class="indented">My father bought this motorcycle in 2014, but for the most part it sat in the shed, and when I pulled it out in summer 2023 it had not run in 4 years. It was in pretty decent shape, with the mods halfway to where I wanted it, but the cafe racer bars and seat were very uncomfortable and the carbs and some electrics needed an overhaul. I fully disassembled and rebuilt the carbs, fixing the jetting for the individual velocity stack intakes that replace the stock airbox. After that I swapped the bars for a more comfortable vintage buckhorn handlebar from a BSA. This also meant swapping the brake line, grips, and hand controls. I selected a new seat that kept with the cafe racer style but is much more comfortable and padded, and fabricated a mounting bracket setup on the water jet cutter. I also cut a new dashboard on the waterjet and replaced the indicator lights with a new matching set. I think the restoration keeps well with the original style, and I managed to keep it to just what is necessary on the bike.</p>

		<p class="indented">This is a project I did over summer 2020 for a BU CS200 class taugh by XRTerra, with 2 classmates. We used the unity game engine to make the simulator, and most of the assets and all the scripting are done from scratch. I made all of the assets as well as some of the scripting and physics.<a href="https://github.com/elatorre20/Packet39-Crane-Simulator">You can download the latest build as well as source code on my github.</a></p>

		<p class="indented">Over the summer of 2021, Dan Berman, curator at the Rhode Island Computer Museum, asked me to design a new kit for use in the Museum's "learn electronics" workshops for elementary-school children. After thinking about what hardware might be interesting for the project, I settled on a Raspberry Pi Pico, because of its low cost and the ability to program it directly in Python. Mike Thompson and I then designed and laid out a circuit board for the hardware I had selected, and we were able to construct several of the kits. The latest iteration costs only $20 for all components and the PCB, allowing us to provide the kit for workshops. Thanks to Dan Berman and RICM for funding the project and Mike Thompson for his help in laying out the board. </p>
